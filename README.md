# Peperoni-Ripieni
DDS based multiphase signal generator with high order analog filter  stage
# Preface
In Math (as well as Physics and Electronics) a sine wave is the most buitiful thing one can get. 
A lot of mathematical issues (with technical applience) can only be solved with respect to linear, sinus based fundamental operations.
Nevertheless generating such a pure sinus wave is not that easy. Conserving it throughout a technical system is eaven more challanging (grid noise, grid feedback).

# What is it good for ?
... well ... to quote Edwin Starr: "absolutely nothing!"   
No just kidding.
